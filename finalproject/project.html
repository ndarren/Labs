        <h2>Projects and Classwork</h2>
        <p>This list outlines some of my achievments and previous classwork throughout my years at UWB. I used to pursue
            Computer Science but now I have found a passion within Data Science so there may be some overlap between
            content.</p>

        <h2>Free Flo Project</h2>
        <h4>BIS 232: Introduction to Data Visualization</h4>
        <img src="media/freeflo.png" height="600px">
        <p>In this project, I got the chance to work with one community partner that the professor had connections with.
            FreeFlo is a non-profit project created to supply women with menstual products from supply boxes similar to
            the book cabinets seen throughout neighborhoods. Me and my group partners collaborated in order to visualize
            trends in data collected by our partner that would constantly updated. We learned and applied our skills in
            Tableau, a data visualization software. This was one of my main inspirations to pursue data science when
            working on this project, it was fun to see the actual impacts it had on the greater audience.</p>

        <h2>Teaching Programming Skills to Kids</h2>
        <h4>CSS 295: K-12 Computing Education</h4>
        <img src="media/css395.png" height="600px">
        <p>This class consisted of a period where the class got familiar with the tools of Scratch and orginizing
            educational content. We worked as groups to present our content in a few run throughs before going out. We
            taught at Jackson Park YTP, to children between the ages of 6-12. With such a wide range of ages, it was
            difficult at first to organize our content to appeal to the kids but we worked together as a group to gauge
            their level of learning and how much content we could cover in the short 5 weeks. I worked with a group of 3
            people to cover loops and if statements.</p>

        <h2>Design Practice</h2>
        <h4>BIMD 250: Introduction to Interaction Design</h4>
        <img src="media/figma.png">
        <p>In this quarter long project, we were tasked to make a app that would be used to suit the needs of astronauts
            as they travel to Mars in a imaginative setting. We went through the design process, starting with the
            reasearch needed to fit their needs, experimented with mood boards to get the theme, went through user
            testing, and went through multiple interations to get the one we wanted. I worked with a team of 3 to
            collaborate and organize our project. </p>
