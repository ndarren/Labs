        For my portfolio page, I am estimating around 3-4 pages with one main page where it displays the main items and
        the latter showing the content in more detail. The first page will be going through images of projects I’ve done
        in the past probably using a carousel under a navigation menu. I’m going to have a responsive navigation menu so
        that the user recognizes what buttons are being clicked/hovered over. If I have time, I may include a parallax
        effect on the main page so that it would look a bit cooler which would be a combination of CSS and Javascript!
        The informational pages will cover more on my academic journey and go into detail of the projects I’ve worked
        on. For a main color palette, probably a white background with a dark blue primary color with green highlights.

        For interactivity, I could use Javascript to expand and close text boxes if anyone wants to see the extra
        information. Another idea would be to use Javascript in order to send emails of inquiry if needed to my personal
        email. I would have separate folders for images, CSS, and Javascript so that working with the HTML would be a
        bit easier. Since only the main page will have a different format than the other content pages, I would just
        have two CSS files in order to keep the pages consistent. Mostly, I would keep the main body text in a left
        alignment, possibly with headings that are centered within the page. If needed, page anchors would be added if
        the content stretches for a while. These are my plans for the project for now and are subject to change in the
        future as I work further on this project.
